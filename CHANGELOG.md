# Changelog

All notable changes to `@idenstra/messaging-runtime` must be tracked here.

- release sections use `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- the `package.json` version must have a matching changelog section before release
- breaking changes under `0.x` must be called out explicitly in the matching release notes
